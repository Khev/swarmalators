# swarmalators

Here is some homemade code that I wrote to simulate swarmalators. The sandbox.ipynb contains an intro, and shows how to use the functions (which is straightforward).

The stability_of_static_async.ipynb contains some work on, well, the stability of the static asycn state, that I wasn't able to figure out fully.
